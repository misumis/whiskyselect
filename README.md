# whiskyselect
React + Redux Express MYSQL web application

It is simple CRUD just for testing and having fun. Figuring out how the relations work in databases and learning Redux and React.
# How to start:

!!! whiskyselect works only locally for now !!!

I use MAMP for starting local server.

// Mock some data and create database
> node database.js create

// Starts server
> npm start

// Go to client
> cd client
Open second terminal
// install node modules
> npm install

// run client
> npm start
